# CSV quality checker

This is the beginnings or a skeleton or framework for a verification
tool for CSV files. The aim is for it to be fast enough to verify
files as they are being uploaded by users to a server, i.e. without
adding any additional waiting to the upload itself and without having
to upload the whole file if there are issues in the file. It currently
handles about a saturated 1 gbit/s network connection on a reasonably
fast server, while using a single CPU core. Of course the speed
depends on how costly the file verifications need to be. The timing
here includes 1/3-1/2 of the data volume (2 out of 6 columns) being
checked via a regular expression, and 2 columns being parsed as
integers, probably a pretty realistic workload.

The program is written in Rust, and currently requires the checks to
be written in that language.

It reports back a stream of check failures (which could of course be
cut off after n failures, tallied, etc.).

It has a streaming architecture, i.e. is holding only one row of the
CSV file in memory at a time (as long as no verificators need to
retain memory e.g. to cross-verify cells), and thus runs in constant
memory.

Currently this is a proof of concept / early version that runs on the
command line only.

## Possible future work

* Verification of the header row.

* Auto-detection of the line encoding (CR/LF/CRLF), separators (tab
  etc.), and charset encoding (UTF-8 etc.) -- try parsing multiple
  ways (in parallel on multiple cores) in case of ambiguities.

* Transforming the file during upload, e.g.:

    * recode into a canonical format instead of rejecting the file
    * remove trailing whitespace from cells

* Implement upload, by either embedding an HTTP server or implementing
  FastCGI, CGI, or other server integration protocol, and adding a
  simple HTML/JavaScript web app for the upload that can show the back
  stream of check failures while still uploading (to enable a manual
  decision to cancelling while still uploading).

* If interesting for users, allow client side verification in the
  user's browser without upload, via WASM.

* Allow the configuration of file verifications without having to
  write Rust code (using atomic checkers predefined in Rust).

* Prevent resource exhaustion attacks: 

    * make sure that overly long CSV rows and cells are handled
      gracefully
    * implement file size, number of files per second, number of files
      per IP limits

* Performance work (if warranted):

    * Profile and optimize.
    * More performance, if necessary, could also be gained using
      parallelism, by dispatching the incoming stream in chunks to
      multiple threads.
